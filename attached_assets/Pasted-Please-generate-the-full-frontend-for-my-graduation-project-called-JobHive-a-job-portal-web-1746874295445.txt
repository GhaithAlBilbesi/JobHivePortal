Please generate the full **frontend** for my graduation project called **JobHive**, a job portal web application aimed to help students and fresh graduates find jobs and internships. The goal is to build a fully responsive and clean React-based frontend using **only HTML, CSS, JS, and React** (no Tailwind CSS at all).

🎯 **Project Description**
JobHive is a modern platform that empowers students and recent graduates by offering:
- Personalized job recommendations
- Resume-building tools
- Employer-student direct messaging
- Filters by skills, location, job type
- Clean dashboard for job tracking

📌 **Design and Layout**
- Main Theme Colors: `#FFD700` (Gold), `#F6C500` (Yellow), `#FFFFFF` (White), `#000000` (Black)
- Use this Figma as the design reference: [https://www.figma.com/design/OsHqSO2XA4BP12JoMqMz2i/JobHive-Project?node-id=0-1](https://www.figma.com/design/OsHqSO2XA4BP12JoMqMz2i/JobHive-Project?node-id=0-1)
- Hero Section should include this line **exactly**:  
  `"Sweet opportunities for the NewBees!"`
- Add animated bee icons flying around the hero section text and randomly around the page (SVG or GIF, looped, light weight)
- Add subtle animations on buttons and sections using CSS animations or lightweight animation libraries
- Hero image should be exactly like this reference image (attached): `WhatsApp Image 2025-05-03 at 7.13.31 PM (1).jpeg` (place this image to the right of the hero text, with some bees floating around)
- Buttons: "Explore Jobs" (yellow primary) and "For Employers" (outlined version)

⚙️ **Technology Stack**
- React.js (latest version)
- HTML, CSS (no preprocessors like SASS)
- JavaScript ES6+
- No Tailwind CSS
- No Bootstrap
- Use React libraries only if needed (e.g. framer-motion for animation)

🧠 **Development Requirements**
- File structure must be **human-readable** and logically separated (e.g., `components`, `pages`, `assets`, `styles`)
- Every component and logic section must include **professional code comments** that explain:
  - What the component does
  - Why it was written this way
  - Any relevant logic decisions
- Keep the code as **simple and clean** as possible, avoid unnecessary complexity
- Make sure the UI is fully **responsive on desktop, tablet, and mobile**

📝 **Output a README file** that includes:
- Project setup and run instructions
- Description of each major file or folder
- How to replace assets (like images, text)
- Explanation of the design decisions taken
- How animations and bees are integrated
- Notes for future contributors

🧪 **Optional Add-ons (if time permits)**
- Simulated user login with role: Student | Employer
- Placeholder cards for "Latest Jobs"
- Scroll-based section reveal animations
- Sticky header with scroll shrink effect

🐞 **Testing & Compatibility**
- Compatible with all modern browsers
- Mobile-first design
- Test accessibility (contrast, keyboard nav)

📸 **Assets Provided**
- Logo: JobHive logo (hexagon with bee)
- Hero Image: “WhatsApp Image 2025-05-03 at 7.13.31 PM (1).jpeg”
- Figma link with design and colors

🎯 Final Goal: A polished frontend codebase I can build on and connect later to a Node.js + MongoDB backend.

Please make sure the code is clear, modular, and production-ready.
